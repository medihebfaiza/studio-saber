# Studio Saber : A Photography Studio Web Application
## Web Project
### Presentation
Web Project is the project undertaken as mandatory requirement for the subject “Web Architecture” that is being conducted by Polytech Montpellier France in the 3rd year of Computer Science and Management Engineering course.
The aim of the course is to learn about the different aspects of Web Architecture like Protocols, Data Representation, Transfer Methods, Security, etc.
### Instructions
For this Project, we, students, have the freedom to choose our own subject for the web application.
Accordingly, i chose to make a web application for a Photography Studio that i have worked at in Tunisia.
We also have the freedom to choose the Web architecture that we see fits for the subject. Therefore, the choice of each of the technologies used in the project must be justified.
The Database used for the project must be available for reading and writing data
Authentication counts as a bonus in the project. However, one must never ever use Sessions.
A trophy called ICAR will be offered to the student who has the best web application.  
### Studio Saber
Studio Saber is a Photography Studio owned by Moez Ishak and located in Bizerte in the north of Tunisia. The Studio is well known in the region and has its own client base. Studio Saber is specialized in Wedding Photography but also does other events like Parties, Concerts, PhotoShoots, Seminars, School Photos, etc. 
The Studio offers several other services for the clients like Equipment Renting, Photo Editing, Video Montage and even Advertisement Posters Design.
During busy seasons, bookings and rents increase very much soo it gets so difficult to manage them.
That is why i decided to solve this problem by creating a web application that allows Clients to book a Photographer or rent Equipment online.
 
 
 
 
### Specification
Here’s how Studio Saber works :
The owner hires several Staff members. A Staff Member can be a Photographer or a Cameraman or both and has an email address, telephone number, photo, description and his own wage.
Clients are identified with their email address and have their first-name, last-name, telephone number and a password to login and book staff members or rent equipment.
Clients can book a Photographer/Cameraman for a certain Event which has a name, date, address and a duration (in hours). The Client’s bookings are to be confirmed by the owner.
Every Equipment has a name, type (Camera, Camcorder or Accessory), description, image, rental (per day), and it can be available or not.
When Renting an Equipment the date and duration are saved and the Equipment is reserved for 48h for the client to retrieve it from the Studio. Rents are also to be confirmed by the Studio’s owner.
